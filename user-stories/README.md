# User Stories

User stories are a tool used in Agile development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. They are used to create a shared understanding of the feature between the development team and the stakeholders.

A user story should be:

* **Independent**: The user story should make sense on its own and not be dependent on any other user story.
* **Negotiable**: The user story should be open to negotiation and discussion between the development team and stakeholders.
* **Valuable**: The user story should have value to the end-user and stakeholders.
* **Estimable**: The user story should be able to be estimated by the development team in terms of complexity and effort required.
* **Testable**: The user story should be able to be tested and validated by the development team.
* **Small**: The user story should be a small, self-contained piece of work that can be completed in a short amount of time.

User stories are typically used in conjunction with acceptance criteria to ensure that the feature is developed correctly. Acceptance criteria are a set of statements that define when a user story is complete.

## Example of a User Story

As a user, I want to be able to reset my password so that I can access my account in case I forget my password.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* The user can enter their email address to reset their password.
* The user receives an email with a link to reset their password.
* The user can enter a new password and confirm it.
* The user is logged in to their account after resetting their password.

## What is a good user story?

A good user story should be:

* **Clear**: The user story should be easy to understand and unambiguous.
* **Concise**: The user story should be brief and to the point.
* **Relevant**: The user story should be relevant to the project and stakeholders.
* **Estimable**: The user story should be able to be estimated by the development team.
* **Testable**: The user story should be able to be tested and validated by the development team.
* **Prioritizable**: The user story should be able to be prioritized by the stakeholders.
